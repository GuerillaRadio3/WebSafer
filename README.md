# WebSafer
Hi! My name is Isaiah Stanke and welcome to my first public Py project, WebSafer! It's kind of bare bones and I'm sure needs a lot of work so please suggest changes! I don't follow the rules of good code like I should either but as updates come then it will be better!. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this and I hope that you enjoy it, if you have any 
issues or suggestions then please put them on here! Please also pay close attention to the license I have put on it. WebSafer blocks websites via the system's hosts file.
It does so in a nice and complete way, and clean. It's use can be for anything, from keeping your grandma safe from those scammers to establishing a safer enviroment for your office! (I am planning on pushing out a paid enterprise edition). Thank you again for downloading my code, or even looking at it. I hope it brings you joy <3 *YOU MUST RUN THIS TOOL IN AN ELEVATED PRIVILEGED COMMAND PROMPT AND THIS ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!*

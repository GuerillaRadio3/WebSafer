# WebSafer
Hi! My name is *redacted* and welcome to my first public Py project, WebSafer! It's kind of bare bones and I'm sure needs a lot of work. I'm not the best at scripting 
nor do I follow the rules of good code like I should. Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to read this and I hope that you enjoy it, if you have any 
issues or suggestions then please put them on here! Please also pay close attention to the license I have put on it. WebSafer blocks websites via the system's hosts file.
It does so in a nice and complete way, and clean. It's use can be for anything, from keeping your grandma safe from those scammers to trolling your work buddy and seeing
him rage in the office. Thank you again for downloading my code, or even looking at it. I hope it brings you joy <3
